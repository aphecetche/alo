Tools to move the AliRoot MCH mapping into O2 era.

The starting point is to convert the custom text files used in the MCH mapping 
(in `AliRoot/MUON/mapping/data`) into [JSON](http://www.json.org) format.

Moving to a widely established text format means : 

- we no longer need custom parsers (`AliMp***Reader` classes in AliRoot)
- the files can easily be read in other languages (think Javascript for the display(s))
- some libraries (e.g. [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/)) can be used to easily 
get a binary representation of those files, if need be.

For the JSON encoding/decoding we rely on the [RapidJSON](http://rapidjson.org) library. 

Compared to a hand-cooked solution (e.g. using bare `cout`)
RapidJSON has the advantage of producing valid JSON or just crash, 
 so we are sure to produce legal JSON every time. Plus it can also write pretty or compact JSON with a simple 
  class selection. Plus it can read back and parse JSON as well, of course.  

This directory is split in :

- `creator` with the classes that actually convert the Aliroot mapping objects into JSON files
- `codegen` which reads the JSON files built by the creator and turns them into C++ code to be used in O2
