This directory is supposed to contain the various [data converters](https://alice.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/MRRTF-17)
(from Run2 to Run3 formats) that are due for MRRTF.

The starting point for the moment is just what was used in the past to
 produce [digit files for MB Pb-Pb](http://aphecetche.github.io/2016/03/13/o2-create-digit-files/) : 
  a bunch of functions quickly stuffed in a single class... Will certainly need some work to expand from there...
